					<h1 class="head">KAMBA SERVAI FESTIVAL</h1>

					<p class="para paragraph">In Tamil Nadu, Nagapattinam District Sirkazhi Taluk, Alakkudi Village,
						Chitrai Vaikasi, the annual summer season on the lower street for centuries
						On Saturdays in the month, the Dharaniyar family visited Sri Venkatesa Perumal
						A ceremony of worship.

					</p>
					<p class="para paragraph para-2">In this festival, as there is no image of Perumal, the Dipa Gampa
						is called “Karuda Kampam” and
						all kinds of abhishekams are performed and worship is done by lighting a big lamp, so this
						festival is called Kampaserva Festival. Also, instead of the idol of Perumal, “Kardun, Chakram,
						Namam, Sangu, Hanuman” are used in the place of worship. They draw the five Vaishnava symbols
						and worship them by tying flower garlands and tulsi garlands and donating food to the poor..</p>

					<p class="para paragraph">In Tamil Nadu, several hundred years ago Mr. Venkatesalu Naidu lived
						richly with his wife and people, with their own bonds, land plots and coconut groves. At that
						time, each family had an epithet to identify them.
						Accordingly Venkatesalu Naidu family was called “Dharaniyar family”.
					</p>
					<p class="para para-2 paragraph">Venkatesalu Naidu was a great Vaishnava devotee. Always thinking of
						Tirupati Venkatesa Perumal and chanting the name Narayana. I have the word welfare. He lived
						with the name “Narayana” as his mantra. Venkatesalu Naidu used to go to Tirupati with his family
						every year to visit Tirumala Venkatesa Perumala.</p>

					<p class="para paragraph">Venkatesalu Naidu used to go to Tirupati with his family every year to
						visit
						Tirumala Venkatesa Perumal. In those days, going to Tirupati and visiting Perumal was a very
						difficult task. Those who cannot go to Tirupati will worship those who have
						visited there as well. Lord Venkatesalu Naidu, who visited Tirupati Venkatesap Perumal every
						year, was greatly pleased
						with his devotion, appeared in his dream and asked him not to come to Tirupati and visit me from
						next year. </p>
					<p class="para paragraph para-2">
						He said that I will come to your town and give darshan to the people of your town.
						And Bhagavan said to him, I do not need a form, I will come as Arupama and grace you, you can
						worship Me with the form that appears in you. I will come and give darshan to my devotee Hanuman
						in Garuda vehicle. You should accompany me with offerings and give food to those who are very
						hungryafterworship

						the hungry
						people. Servants are happy, is not the Lord happy! As soon as the day dawned, Venkatesalu Naidu
						gathered his family, relatives, and villagers
						together to tell what Perumal had said in his dream. With the slogan “Govinda Govinda”, all the
						people of the village were immersed in devotional ecstasy. They all got together and unanimously
						decided to hold the Kampaserva ceremony. Venkatesalu Naidu gave a piece of land and a coconut
						grove free of charge from his property to worship Perumal.
